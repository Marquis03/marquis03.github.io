# 🌟 About Me

My name is **Jue Hou (侯爵)**. Literally, 侯爵 denotes a noble title from ancient China, roughly the English equivalent of "**marquis**".

I graduated from <a href='https://www.swufe.edu.cn/'>Southwestern University of Finance and Economics <img src='./images/title/SWUFE.png' alt="Southwestern University of Finance and Economics" style="height: 1em;"></a> with a bachelor’s degree in 2025.

I am currently a master student at <a href='https://www.xmu.edu.cn/'>Xiamen University <img src='./images/title/XMU.png' alt="Xiamen University" style="height: 1em;"></a>, advised by [Prof. Jinsong Su (苏劲松)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w6qCk3sAAAAJ).
